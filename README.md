# Elasticsearch
A simple spring-data-elasticsearch Project. 
During the creation of this project Elasticsearch v 6.2.0 was available but spring-data-elasticsearch didnot update to communicate with this version. So, Elasticsearch 5.5.0 was used in this project. You will have to download elasticsearch 5.5.0 in your machine if you are not willing to use embedded elasticsearch server which is instatntiated when embedded node client is used instead of transport client.
